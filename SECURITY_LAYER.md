# üîê Security Layer - Image Verification

## Overview
This application now includes an AI-powered security layer that validates uploaded images to ensure they are genuine chest X-rays before processing.

## How It Works

### Image Verification Process
1. **Upload Detection**: When a user uploads an image, it's first sent to the verification function
2. **Gemini Vision API**: The image is analyzed by Google's Gemini AI model
3. **Validation Checks**: The AI verifies if the image is:
   - A medical chest X-ray (radiograph)
   - Shows thoracic cavity (lungs, heart, ribs)
   - In proper radiographic format
   - Not other types of scans (CT, MRI, ultrasound)
   - Not X-rays of other body parts
4. **Response**: Returns validation result with confidence level and reason

### Security Features
- ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash model for accurate image classification
- ‚úÖ **Prevents False Submissions**: Blocks non-medical images, photos, random images
- ‚úÖ **User-Friendly Error**: Shows clear error message with instructions
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Fallback**: If API fails, logs error but allows processing (configurable)
- ‚úÖ **Console Logging**: All verification attempts are logged for monitoring

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Google API Key (Gemini) - Get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Set in `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Configuration
The verification is automatic when `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set. If not set, the security layer is skipped (but logged as warning).

## Code Implementation

### verify_xray_image() Function
Located in `web_app.py`, this function:
- Takes uploaded file as input
- Sends to Gemini Vision API
- Returns `(is_valid: bool, message: str)` tuple

### Integration in /generator Route
```python
# Verify image before processing
is_valid, verification_message = verify_xray_image(file)

if not is_valid:
    # Show error page
    return render_template("error.html", error_message=verification_message, ...)
    
# Continue with normal processing...
```

## User Experience

### Valid X-ray Upload
- ‚úÖ Image passes verification
- ‚úÖ Console shows: "‚úÖ Image validation passed"
- ‚úÖ Proceeds to generate report normally

### Invalid Image Upload
- ‚ùå Image fails verification
- ‚ùå Console shows: "üö´ Image validation failed: [reason]"
- ‚ùå User sees beautiful error page with:
  - Clear error message
  - Explanation of what went wrong
  - Instructions for valid images
  - Button to try again

## Error Page (templates/error.html)
Beautiful, user-friendly error page with:
- üé® Red/orange gradient design
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large warning icon
- üìã Clear instructions
- üîÑ "Try Again" button
- üí° Helpful tips

## Testing

### Run Test Script
```bash
python test_security.py
```

This creates a fake test image (`test_fake_image.jpg`) you can upload to test the security feature.

### Manual Testing
1. Start app: `python web_app.py`
2. Upload different types of images:
   - ‚úÖ Real chest X-ray ‚Üí Should pass
   - ‚ùå CT scan ‚Üí Should reject
   - ‚ùå Photo of person ‚Üí Should reject
   - ‚ùå Random image ‚Üí Should reject
   - ‚ùå Other body part X-ray ‚Üí Should reject

## Console Output Examples

### Successful Verification:
```
‚úÖ Image verified as chest X-ray (confidence: high)
‚úÖ Image validation passed: Valid chest X-ray image
```

### Failed Verification:
```
‚ùå Image rejected: This appears to be a photograph, not a medical X-ray
üö´ Image validation failed: Invalid image: This appears to be a photograph, not a medical X-ray
```

### API Error (Fallback):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Image verification error: API key not configured
‚ö†Ô∏è GOOGLE_API_KEY not set. AI-enhanced reports will use fallback mode.
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents misuse of the system with non-medical images
2. **Data Quality**: Ensures model only processes appropriate inputs
3. **User Guidance**: Educates users on proper image requirements
4. **Monitoring**: All attempts logged for audit trail
5. **Reliability**: Graceful degradation if API unavailable

## Customization

### Adjust Verification Strictness
Edit the prompt in `verify_xray_image()` function to make it more or less strict.

### Change Fallback Behavior
Currently, if API fails, it allows the image. To reject instead:
```python
# In verify_xray_image(), change:
return True, f"Verification skipped due to error: {str(e)}"
# To:
return False, f"Verification failed due to error: {str(e)}"
```

### Modify Error Page
Edit `templates/error.html` to customize the error message design and content.

## API Costs
- Gemini API calls: ~$0.00025 per image verification (varies by region)
- Free tier: 15 requests per minute
- More info: https://ai.google.dev/pricing

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All images pass verification
- Check if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Verify API key has access to Gemini models
- Check console for verification logs

### Issue: All images fail verification
- Check API key permissions
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check Gemini API status

### Issue: Verification takes too long
- Gemini API typically responds in 1-3 seconds
- If slower, check network connection
- Consider implementing timeout in code

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add caching for repeated image hashes
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add admin override for special cases
- [ ] Store verification logs in database
- [ ] Add batch verification for multiple uploads
